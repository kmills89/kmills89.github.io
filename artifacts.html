      <h2>Weight Tracker Application</h2>
      <p>
        The Weight Tracker Application was initially developed during the
        **CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming** course as part of my
        Computer Science degree. The purpose of the application is to allow
        users to track their weight over time, helping them monitor progress
        toward their fitness goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        For my final project in **CS-499**, I enhanced the application by
        improving data structure management, user experience, and database
        optimization.

      <h3>Before and After Enhancements</h3>

      <h4>Before Enhancements</h4>
      <p>
        Originally, the app stored daily weight logs that required users to
        manually enter a date and weight each time. This approach made tracking
        historical data less intuitive and required more manual effort.

      <h4>After Enhancements</h4>
      <p>
        The enhanced version introduces a week-based tracking system,
        automatically organizing weight data into weekly segments for better
        usability. The UI has also been improved for a cleaner, more intuitive
        experience.
