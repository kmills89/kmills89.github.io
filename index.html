      <h2>Welcome to My ePortfolio</h2>
      <p>
        This ePortfolio showcases my experience, skills, and project
        enhancements as part of my Computer Science Capstone at Southern New
        Hampshire University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, you will find my professional self-assessment, code review, and
        artifacts demonstrating my growth in software engineering, data
        structures, and database optimization.

      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, I have developed
        expertise in software development, database management, and secure
        coding practices. Completing my coursework and enhancing my artifacts
        have allowed me to refine my skills in designing efficient software
        solutions, optimizing databases, and implementing security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ePortfolio is a reflection of my ability to collaborate,
        communicate technical concepts, and apply data structures and algorithms
        effectively. Through my work, I have demonstrated my capability in
        software engineering, security best practices, and full-stack
        development.
      </p>
